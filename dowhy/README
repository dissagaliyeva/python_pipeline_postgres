The normal download of the R package crashes the notebooks! In order to overcome this:

1. remove all R installations
2. open up current conda environment  
3. run `conda install conda-forge::r-base`
4. get the path to R in the envs folder (inside conda env)
5. run `import rpy2.robjects as robjects`
